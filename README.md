This project is written in Laravel and Vuejs. It is built using Laravel Sail, hence you can run `vendor/bin/sail up` to start up the project.

If you however want to run this project locally, here are some important dependencies to take note of.

1. PHP 8.1
2. Laravel 9.21
3. MySQl 8.0

All Javascript dependencies can be installed using NPM `npm install`. And asset bundling is done with Laravel mix. You can run `npm run dev` to bundle the assets.
